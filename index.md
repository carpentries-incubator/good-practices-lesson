This lesson grows a researchers' software skills necessary to apply good practices that enable open and reproducible research. 
The lesson focuses on building modular, reusable, maintainable, sustainable, reproducible, testable, and robust software. 
This will allow you to more easily organize, maintain and share your code. 

The main themes that are addressed are generically applicable, but please note that a lot of the exercises and demonstrations are in Python.

This workshop is heavily inspired by and based on the awesome [CodeRefinery training materials](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/).

#### Intermediate research software development?
If you find the topics that are covered in this lesson too basic, you could consider the [Intermediate Research Software Development](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/) lesson.
That lesson has a similar focus, but also teaches more intermediate topics like software architecture, advanced coding best practices, 
Integrated Software Development environments and is targeted to slightly more advanced research software engineers.

#### Collaborative version control with Git and GitHub
For this lesson you need some basic knowledge of Git and GitHub. 
We recommend going through the [Collaborative version control with Git and GitHub lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/collaborative-git-and-github-lesson/)
before going through this material.
